    "- **Regular expressions** are special sequences of characters that describe a pattern of text that is to be matched\n",
    "- We can use literals to match the exact characters that we desire\n",
    "- **Alternation**, using the pipe symbol |, allows us to match the text preceding or following the |\n",
    "- **Character sets**, denoted by a pair of brackets [], let us match one character from a series of characters\n",
    "- **Wildcards**, represented by the period or dot ., will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace)\n",
    "- **Ranges** allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match\n",
    "- **Shorthand character classes** like \\w, \\d and \\s represent the ranges representing word characters, digit characters, and whitespace characters, respectively\n",
    "- **Groupings**, denoted with parentheses (), group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of a regex\n",
    "- **Fixed quantifiers**, represented with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity or a range of quantity of a character we wish to match\n",
    "- **Optional quantifiers**, indicated by the question mark ?, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time\n",
    "- The **Kleene star**, denoted with the asterisk *, is a quantifier that matches the preceding character 0 or more times\n",
    "- The **Kleene plus**, denoted by the plus +, matches the preceding character 1 or more times\n",
    "- The **anchor** symbols hat ^ and dollar sign $ are used to match text at the start and end of a string, respectively"
